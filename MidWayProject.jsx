//****************************************** Super Mario ***********************************************/

//! The API ->
// Create my own mockAPI for high score users --> basically type a new name everytime you start the game. and at the end push the highscore? but how im gonna implement a highscore? and for what

//Crud? still no idea where to use? maybe to remove and edit old users

//! Pages ->
// Homepage + Rules --> Says the rules of the game and how to beat it? --> Map of the highscores
//First world ---> Game
//Second World?? --> Going down a pipe to a new identical but different world??? I guess
//Page for users --> Like an Admin Panel


//! Functions to have :

// DrawMap function --> Canvas or grid?? --> React
// Player function --> Includes a left and right moving function with jump
// Monster Function --> moving left and right
// Pipe --> going to another level function

//! Thinks i need to figure out :
//? Hit the box above to get a special gift?????????????
//? What happens when a monstar and Mario hit each other
//? Learn about Canvas with React
//? useContext looks helpful in this project. according to links saved down below :

//? Two Way Auth --> Basically with google
// Auth 2.0 
//! Google sign-in Auth API + MockAPI to save data for the users. --> Player name / Google name and his score



//! With Pini

//Two stage auth -> 2 Ways to lock in -> Unique username Ex: "Pini" -> This will add Pini in the mockApi
// And if its already in the API it says user already exists
// Sound Effects for Mario

//! Player can play if he is logged in or not -> If not
